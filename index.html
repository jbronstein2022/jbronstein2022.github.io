        <h1 > Inspiration</h1>
        <p>
            Over quaratine, I was absolutely stunned by how much many people made through 
            r/wallstreetbets. I still don't understand what exactly happened other than
            someone named DeepF******Value created a social movement that's sole purpose was
            to buy GameStop and hold for as long as possible because it was going to the "moon".
            I think that a Neural Network would probably beat DeepF******Value so I want to investigate.

        <h1> Project Description</h1>
    <p>
        The crux of my project is to create a Neural Network that will use intraday stock data and news areticle concerning securities. 
        Using reinforcement learning, the NN will decide whehther to buy, sell, or hold a position regarding a security using information from media outlets
        and global trends within a stock's respective subsector within the economy. The project would target large market cap stocks mainly
        because such stocks generate more news regarding product releases and earning reports.
