        The crux of my project is to create a Neural Network that will use intraday stock data. 
        Using reinforcement learning, the NN will decide whehther to buy, sell, or hold a based on security information
        and global trends within the that a stock's respective subsector within the economy. The project would target large market cap stocks mainly
        because such stocks generate more news regarding product releases and earning reports.
